# Project Futbol-club âš½

<p>It was an informative website about football matches and rankings. In this project, the challenge was to build a dockerized back-end using data modeling with Sequelize, always respecting the business rules. The API should be consumable by the front-end, which had already been developed and made available by the Trybe course.

This project was built using TDD methodologies.</p>
